# Decoupling Roadmap

This is the implementation roadmap for converting the portfolio into a highly decoupled, plug-and-play static application without changing its visual language or CMS data model unnecessarily.

## Current implementation checkpoint

As of October 3, 2026, the branch has completed the first composition/data-boundary slice of the migration without changing the public visual baseline:

- `js/script.js` is a 19-line browser entrypoint.
- `js/app/bootstrap.js` owns startup/error containment and passes normalized application configuration into the composition root.
- `js/app/page-composition.js` is the explicit wiring layer for page features and infrastructure.
- Projects, Gallery, Hero, Lightbox, Navigation, Reviews, About, Forms, and Settings now have feature entry points.
- CMS project data and site settings are normalized before presentation.
- Three.js, media-background, YouTube parsing, Lottie loading, site paths, and reduced-motion are isolated behind infrastructure modules.
- The obsolete `cms-data.js` and `site-runtime.js` runtime facades have been removed.
- Gallery is the single owner of project-filter state; Lightbox consumes Gallery's active-project contract rather than maintaining a second filter model.
- Architecture and site validators were updated to enforce the new boundaries.
- The validation workflow now includes a real Chromium smoke test covering Works, About, Hero rendering/looping, CMS filters/ALL, and About resume/software content at desktop, phone, and tablet sizes.
- The browser smoke gate has passed on the current runtime cutover after fixing the public ES-module boot path, Hero initialization, CMS filter reconstruction, About CMS rendering, and the CMS 3D preview adapter path.

The remaining work is deliberate rather than wholesale refactoring: strengthen feature lifecycles/cleanup and CSS ownership where they materially reduce coupling, then stop architecture work when the boundaries are sufficient for the Phase 3 artwork-first redesign.

The current deployment gate is intentionally separate from architectural completion: the public pages must load `js/script.js` as an ES module, and each page must provide the import map required by optional vendor infrastructure before this branch can be treated as testable.

The exact split may change during implementation. The dependency boundaries are more important than the folder names.

## Migration strategy

### Stage 0 — completed

- Preserve the current visual baseline.
- Preserve the CMS JSON contract.
- Add architecture documentation.
- Add an architecture dependency validator.
- Add the validator to CI.
- Create a recovery branch before structural migration.

### Stage 1 — composition root

Reduce `js/script.js` to bootstrap/composition responsibilities only.

Move feature implementation out of the root controller without changing behavior.

The bootstrap should be able to express the page approximately as:

```js
const app = createPortfolioApp({
  runtime,
  data,
  features: {
    navigation,
    hero,
    gallery,
    lightbox,
    modelViewer,
    contact
  }
});

await app.start();
```

### Stage 2 — data boundary

Normalize CMS JSON before it reaches UI features.

Example:

```text
CMS JSON
   ↓
loader
   ↓
normalizer
   ↓
PortfolioProject[]
   ↓
feature modules
```

Features should not need to know whether content came from GitHub, a local fallback, or a future backend.

### Stage 3 — infrastructure adapters

Move vendor-specific code behind adapters.

Examples:

```text
Three.js      -> model-viewer adapter
Lottie        -> lottie adapter
GitHub API    -> repository adapter
Web3Forms     -> contact adapter
YouTube       -> video adapter
Storage API   -> browser-storage adapter
```

This permits replacement or removal of a vendor without changing the feature's public contract.

### Stage 4 — feature ownership

Each feature receives:

- explicit root element(s)
- normalized input data
- configuration
- callbacks/events
- lifecycle cleanup

A feature must not search the whole page for unrelated elements as an implicit dependency.

### Stage 5 — state isolation

Remove shared mutable state from the global/root controller.

Each feature owns its own state. Cross-feature communication uses explicit events or callbacks.

### Stage 6 — CSS ownership

Replace historical override layers with component-owned styles.

The objective is not more CSS files. The objective is that a component's responsive, interactive, and visual states live together and can be replaced without fighting unrelated selectors.

### Stage 7 — CMS application boundary

The public site must never import CMS implementation code.

The CMS should be decomposed separately into:

```text
admin/
├── app/
├── features/
│   ├── editor/
│   ├── media-library/
│   └── connection/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── github-api/
│   └── storage/
└── core/
```

The CMS and public portfolio are two applications sharing repository content—not one application with two pages.

### Stage 8 — removal

After each feature is migrated and validated:

1. remove the old implementation;
2. search for references to it;
3. run the site validator;
4. run the architecture validator;
5. run syntax checks;
6. perform browser/device QA;
7. remove obsolete compatibility code.

Do not keep old and new implementations permanently “just in case.” That creates two sources of truth.

## Definition of done

The architecture migration is complete when:

- `script.js` is a small composition root;
- each feature has one public entry point;
- feature state is private;
- CMS data is normalized before presentation;
- vendor APIs are isolated in infrastructure adapters;
- no feature imports another feature's private implementation;
- feature cleanup is deterministic;
- UI redesigns do not require changes to unrelated feature internals;
- the CMS is independently deployable as an application surface;
- CI rejects architecture-boundary violations;
- the production visual baseline remains intentionally unchanged until a UI change is requested.

## Non-goals

This migration must not:

- introduce a framework merely for architecture's sake;
- rewrite the visual design;
- replace the existing CMS data model without a demonstrated need;
- add abstractions that have no consumer;
- create dozens of tiny files with no meaningful ownership boundary;
- preserve deprecated Phase 2.1 redesign layers.
